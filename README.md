## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Adarsh N. I'm a Software Engineer.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Front End Development
Building responsive web applications using React.js, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. Recent projects include an e-commerce platform (NESTMART) and a fitness planner (FitTrack), integrating RESTful APIs and focusing on UI/UX design.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Django, Cybersecurity, Vue.js
Deepening my expertise in React (advanced state management with Redux, React Router), exploring Django for backend development, learning Vue.js for lightweight front-end frameworks, and studying cybersecurity (basic security practices, network protocols, VLANs, and IP addressing).
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
Open-source React or Vue.js projects, particularly in e-commerce, fitness, or movie-related web apps. Iâ€™m also open to UI/UX design projects using Figma or full-stack projects integrating Django/Flask with front-end frameworks.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
Advanced React concepts (e.g., performance optimization, custom hooks), Django REST framework for building scalable APIs, and cybersecurity best practices for securing web applications (e.g., authentication, data protection).
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
Front-end development with React.js, Bootstrap, or Tailwind CSS, creating responsive designs, integrating RESTful APIs, or designing UI/UX prototypes in Figma. I can also share insights on basic Django/Flask or Git workflows.

âš¡ Fun fact
I built a movie recommendation platform inspired by my love for binge-watching sci-fi series, and Iâ€™m secretly a pro at finding the perfect UI color palette in Figma!
